# Hangman

This is a simple Hangman game that is GUI based.

The folder _words_ contains a .txt file with all the words.

I got the words by typing

```
$ cat /usr/share/dict/words > words.txt
```

in the terminal on my MacBook.

## How to run

Download/Clone the repo and enter the *src* folder.

Type

```
$ python3 main.py -h
```

in the terminal window if you are on a Mac and the game will start.

Type

```
$ python main.py -h
```

in the terminal window if you are on a Linux or Windows machine and the game will start.
