# Hangman

This is a simple Hangman game that is GUI based.

The words are choosen at random for each round.

The folder _words_ contains a .txt file with all the words.

I got the words by typing

```
$ cat /usr/share/dict/words > words.txt
```

in the terminal on my MacBook Pro.

## How to run

Download/Clone the repo, enter the src folder and type

```
$ python3 main.py 
```

in your terminal window and the game will start.

The _src_ folder contains source files.
