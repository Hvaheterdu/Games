# RockPaperScissor

This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissor game between you and the computer.

This game is made with the pygame module and gives a simple GUI with images and a score counter.

Better solutions are most likely out there, but this was my first go at using the pygame module.

## GUI

As said, this is a very simple GUI.

When you start the program you are greeted with a "home screen", that looks like

## How to run

Download/Clone the repo and enter the src folder and type

```
$ python3 game.py 
```

in your terminal window and the game will start.

The *src* folder contains the source file.
