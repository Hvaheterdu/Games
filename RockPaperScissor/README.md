# RockPaperScissor

This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissor game between you and the computer.

Better solutions are most likely out there, but this was my first go at using the pygame module.

## GUI

As said, this is a very simple GUI.

When you start the program you are greeted with a "home screen", that looks like

This is an example of how the game looks when you play it

## Install packages

Make sure the pygame packages is installed.

If you don't have it installed, it can be installed by typing

```
$ pip install pygame
```

or

```
$ pip3 install pygame
```

The first one is usually used on Windows when you only have one Python version installed.

The second one is usually used on macOS, because the system uses Python@2.7 and typing *pip* instead of *pip3* will install the package with Python@2.7

*pip3* makes sure the module is installed on the Python@3.x.x version that you have installed.

## How to run

Download/Clone the repo and enter the *src* folder.

Type

```
$ python3 game.py
```

in the terminal window if you are on a Mac and the game will start.

Type

```
$ python game.py
```

in the terminal window if you are on a Linux or Windows machine and the game will start.
